To check whether model accuracy is increasing or not after performing a feature selection.

## How important is feature selection?
Top reasons to use feature selection are:

- It enables the machine learning algorithm to train faster.
- It reduces the complexity of a model and makes it easier to interpret.
- It improves the accuracy of a model if the right subset is chosen.
